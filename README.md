# VitaPath 🚶‍♀️🌃

**VitaPath** is a smart safety-first navigation and urban reporting app designed to make Indian cities safer—especially for women—by tackling the challenges of unsafe routes and poor infrastructure.

## 🚨 Problem

In many Indian cities, walking at night can be risky due to:
- Poor lighting (broken or missing streetlights)
- Potholes and unsafe sidewalks
- High-crime zones and unsafe neighborhoods

These issues are especially problematic for women, who often face increased danger when navigating urban areas after dark.

## ✅ Solution

VitaPath provides two core features to help users move safely and contribute to safer urban spaces:

### 1. SafeRoute Navigation
Finds the **safest, most well-lit** path to your destination using:
- Real-time GPS
- Crime and lighting data
- Smart routing to avoid unsafe zones

### 2. StreetGuardian Reporting
Empowers users to report city hazards with:
- **Photo evidence**
- **GPS location tagging**
- Easy interface for sharing with local authorities or civic platforms

## ✨ Why VitaPath Stands Out

- **Addresses real, daily problems** for millions of urban citizens
- **Empowers communities** to contribute to safer neighborhoods
- **Simple tech stack**: camera, GPS, maps — no fancy hardware required
- **Supports India’s Smart Cities Mission** and **women’s safety goals**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native / Flutter (your actual tech here)
- **Backend**: Node.js / Firebase / Express (update as per your stack)
- **Maps**: Google Maps API / Mapbox
- **Database**: Firestore / MongoDB (or what you used)
